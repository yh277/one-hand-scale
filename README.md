This interaction technique combines head tracking and one-hand detection with a dynamic linear mapping approach to enable intuitive object scaling. Objects are selected by aligning the user's head gaze, and their scale is adjusted using a diagonal hand pinch gesture. The mapping dynamically adjusts the scaling effect by switching between different slopes based on hand movement, providing precise control for both small and large transformations. Unlike traditional methods, this technique seamlessly integrates head tracking and single-hand interaction, allowing for direct and adaptive manipulation of objects across varying distances in virtual and augmented reality environments.
